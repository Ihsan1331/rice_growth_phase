# rice_growth_phase

Indonesia's geographical location has a tropical climate with high rainfall, fog and coverage thick clouds led to the use of optical satellites for growth phase monitoring rice is not optimal. This problem can be overcome by using a sensing system remote active sentinel-1 which is not affected by cloud cover and absence of sunlight. The sentinel-1 satellite also has better spatial resolution, namely 10 m Ã— 10 m very useful for increasing the accuracy of rice growth phase models. This research aims to study, apply, and test the machine learning method to obtain accurate and reliable rice growth phase classification model. This research will be carried out in Subang area of West Java. The remote sensing data used in this research is data obtained from Sentinel-1 satellite. The machine learning method used in this research are TabNet, Random Forest, and XGBoost. All models trained 10 times to ensure the robustness of the model, the accuracy of models are 0.6777, 0.7032, and 0.7033 for Random Forest, XGBoost, and TabNet respetively. It is hoped this research can become a basis for producing phase information national rice growth which can be used as a basis for rice field management and post-harvest processing management.
